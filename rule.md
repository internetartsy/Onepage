# Project Rules

- **Code Organization**: Do not create new project subdirectories or nested project structures. Always work within the existing project root and file structure.
- **Minimal Changes**: Only modify existing files or add files in existing directories (e.g., `src/pages/`, `src/components/`) to maintain the established GitHub organization.
- **Consistency**: Follow the project's historical naming conventions and architectural patterns.
- **Build Integrity**: Always verify that `npm run build` succeeds after any logical or UI changes.
